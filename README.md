**2-element list indexing using a boolean (which is just 0 or 1):**

This is extremely useful when you binary choices for indexing. It can remove the need to write an *if else* statement depending on what the value of the index is.

```
list = ['a', 'b']
list[False]
> 'a'
list[True]
> 'b'
list = ['XXX', 'ZZZ']
current = 'R'
list[current=='R'] # this statement is true
# has chosen the right element
> ZZZ 
```
